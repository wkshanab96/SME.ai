## Introduction

This document specifies a web-based Engineering Manufacturing Equipment CAD application inspired by Edraw.ai, built using React Flow. The application enables users to create, edit, and manage professional engineering diagrams with a focus on manufacturing equipment, supporting electrical, mechanical, and control systems. The specification leverages the comprehensive drawing services outlined in the reference document.

---

## Application Overview

The application is a browser-based CAD tool for engineering professionals, manufacturing designers, and technical teams. It provides a rich library of predefined equipment symbols, advanced drawing and editing tools, and a modern, intuitive user interface. The system is designed for high precision, collaboration, and extensibility.

---

## Engineering Equipment Library

### Categories
- **Electrical Equipment**: Motors, transformers, circuit breakers, relays, control panels, sensors, actuators, wiring symbols, etc.
- **Mechanical Equipment**: Pumps, valves, compressors, tanks, conveyors, gearboxes, piping, flanges, couplings, etc.
- **Control Equipment**: PLCs, HMIs, control valves, transmitters, PID controllers, instrumentation, etc.

### Symbol Properties
- **Standardized vector graphics (SVG) for each symbol**
- **Metadata: name, type, manufacturer, part number, datasheet link**
- **Connection points (ports) for wiring/piping**
- **Customizable properties (e.g., rating, size, tag number)**

### Library Management
- **Search and filter by category, type, or property**
- **Favorites and recently used symbols**
- **Custom symbol creation and import**

## Drawing Services & Tools

The application implements the following services, adapted from the reference specification:

### 1. Object Manipulation
- **Copy**: Duplicate selected equipment, with options for array or path-based copies. Clipboard support.
- **Move**: Relocate equipment by drag-and-drop or coordinate input. Snap/grid support.
- **Delete**: Remove selected objects, with confirmation for bulk deletes.
- **Undo/Redo**: Multi-level, stepwise undo/redo with visual history.

### 2. Transformation
- **Scale**: Uniform/non-uniform scaling of equipment or groups.
- **Resize**: Adjust dimensions of scalable objects (e.g., pipes, rectangles).
- **Rotate**: Rotate objects around a pivot, with angle input or drag.
- **Mirror**: Create mirrored copies across a user-defined axis.

### 3. View Navigation
- **Zoom In/Out**: Mouse wheel, keyboard, or toolbar controls.
- **Pan**: Click-and-drag or keyboard navigation.
- **Fit to View**: One-click fit all or selection to window.
- **View Presets**: Save and recall custom views.

### 4. Selection & Grouping
- **Selection**: Single, multi, lasso, and filter-based selection.
- **Group/Ungroup**: Combine equipment for collective manipulation.

### 5. Layer & Object Management
- **Layer Assignment**: Assign objects to layers, control visibility and lock status.
- **Lock/Unlock**: Prevent editing of selected objects.
- **Hide/Show**: Temporarily remove objects from view.

### 6. Advanced Editing
- **Array/Pattern**: Create rectangular, circular, or path-based arrays of equipment.
- **Align/Distribute**: Align or evenly distribute selected objects.
- **Trim/Extend**: Modify pipes/wires to meet or extend to other objects.
- **Explode/Join**: Break complex objects into parts or join lines/polylines.

### 7. Precision & Constraints
- **Snap/Grid**: Enable/disable snap to grid, objects, or angles. Configurable grid.
- **Object Constraints**: Apply geometric/dimensional constraints (parallel, equal, fixed, etc.).

### 8. Annotation & Markup
- **Markup Tools**: Draw highlights, arrows, clouds, and add text comments.
- **Measurement Tools**: Measure and annotate distances, angles, and areas.

## User Interface & Experience

- **Main Canvas**: Central drawing area with infinite or large workspace, dark/light theme support.
- **Sidebar**: Equipment library with categories, search, and drag-and-drop.
- **Toolbar**: Quick access to drawing tools, undo/redo, zoom, and view controls.
- **Properties Panel**: Edit properties of selected equipment (name, tag, specs, etc.).
- **Layer Panel**: Manage layers, visibility, and lock status.
- **History Panel**: Visual undo/redo stack.
- **Context Menus**: Right-click actions for objects and canvas.
- **Status Bar**: Display coordinates, snap/grid status, and selection info.
- **Responsive Design**: Usable on desktops, tablets, and large touchscreens.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React, React Flow for diagramming, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **State Management**: Redux or Zustand for global state.
- **SVG Rendering**: All equipment and connections rendered as SVG for precision and export.
- **Custom Hooks**: For drawing logic, snapping, constraints, and undo/redo.
- **Modular Components**: Equipment, connectors, annotation, and UI panels as reusable components.

---

## Data Model & Persistence

- **Diagram Model**: JSON structure representing all objects, connections, layers, and properties.
- **Equipment Object**: { id, type, category, position, rotation, scale, properties, layer, locked, hidden }
- **Connection Object**: { id, source, target, type, path, properties }
- **Layer Object**: { id, name, color, visible, locked }
- **History Stack**: For undo/redo operations.
- **Persistence**: Local storage, cloud sync (Firebase/Firestore), and export/import.

---

## Export, Import, and Collaboration

- **Export**: SVG, PNG, PDF, and JSON formats.
- **Import**: JSON diagrams, SVG symbol libraries.
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing (optional, via WebSockets or Firebase).
- **Versioning**: Save and restore previous versions of diagrams.

---

## Security & Permissions

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and role-based access (admin, editor, viewer).
- **Permissions**: Control who can edit, view, or share diagrams.
- **Audit Trail**: Track changes and user actions (for enterprise use).

---

## Extensibility & Customization

- **Plugin System**: Allow third-party or user-created plugins for new equipment, tools, or integrations.
- **Custom Equipment**: Users can create, import, and share custom symbols.
- **Theming**: Support for custom color schemes and UI themes.
