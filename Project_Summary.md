# SME.AI Project Summary

This document provides a summary of the SME.AI project based on the analysis of the provided TODO files: `TODO-AI-Architecture.md`, `TODO-Backend.md`, `TODO-Frontend.md`, and `TODO-Project-Setup.md`.

## AI System Architecture

The SME.AI system is designed around a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to provide specialized domain expertise.

*   **LLM Integration:** The project plans to use **Google Vertex AI's Gemini 1.5 Pro** as the foundation LLM, citing its large context window, multimodal capabilities, competitive pricing, and quality responses.
*   **Vector Database:** **Qdrant** has been selected for its performance, scalability, advanced filtering, payload storage, and ease of use.
*   **Embedding Models:** **Vertex AI Embeddings** will be used for text-to-vector transformation, optimized for technical documents and semantic search.

The RAG system design involves user queries passing through query processing to the vector database for context retrieval. The retrieved context is assembled and fed into the LLM (Gemini), which generates a response. This response is then processed before being presented to the user interface.
